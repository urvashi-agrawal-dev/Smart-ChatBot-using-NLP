# 🤖 Smart Chatbot for Customer Support using NLP

This is a beginner-friendly chatbot project built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. The chatbot can understand user messages, detect intent (like greeting, password reset, goodbye), and respond with helpful replies — all built and tested in **Google Colab**.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

To build a simple, smart chatbot that can:
- Understand user queries using NLP
- Identify user **intent** (what they want)
- Provide a suitable **response** automatically

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NLTK** – for text processing and lemmatization
- **Scikit-learn** – for training a machine learning model
- **JSON** – to store intents (patterns and responses)
- **Google Colab** – to code and test the project
